# Random Group Generator

This project is a simple web application that generates random groups from a list of names.

## Files

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that structures the web application. It includes input fields for names and the number of groups, and buttons to generate the groups and export the results.

- `script.js`: This JavaScript file contains the functionality of the web application. It includes functions to generate random groups from the input names, export the groups to a CSV file, and display error messages.

- `groups.txt`: This file is generated when the user exports the groups. It contains the groups in a text format.
